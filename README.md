# Phased array patch antenna @10GHz

Objective: “Design a 1D patch phased array of 10 elements with corporate feeding network for broadside radiation, target return loss is -10 dB. Calculate the radiation pattern analytically and numerically and compare them. If you want you can select the operating frequency yourself, otherwise use 10 GHz.”
